What is Programming ?

Programming is a very natural and intuitive concept. A
program is nothing more than a series of statements written in
a specific language. Programs are everywhere, and even the
technophobes of the world use programs every day. Driving
directions, cooking recipes, football plays, and DNA are all
types of programs.
